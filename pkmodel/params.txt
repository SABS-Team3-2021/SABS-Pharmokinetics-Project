This documents the variables defined in params.json

Variables in the IV (Intravenous Bolus) Model:

    V_c: [mL] - the volume of the central compartment
    V_p: [mL] - the volume of the peripheral compartment

    Q_p: [mL/h] - the transition rate between central compartment and peripheral compartment
    CL: [mL/h] - the clearance/elimination rate from the central compartment

    q_c0: [ng] - the initial drug quantity in the central compartment
    q_p0: [ng] - the initial drug quantity in the periphery compartment


Additional Variables in the Sub (Subcutaneous) Model:

    k_a: [/h] - the “absorption” rate from the entrance compartment for the subcutaneous dosing.
    q_e0: [ng] - the initial drug quantity in the entrance compartment

Additional Variables for N Compartment Models (either IV or Sub)
    These are all for the i-th compartment, replace i with the compartment number (e.g. 'V_p2')

    V_pi: [mL] - the volume of the i-th peripheral compartment
    Q_pi: [mL/h] - the transition rate between central compartment and the i-th peripheral compartment
    q_pi_0: [ng] - the initial drug quantity in the i-th periphery compartment
